## 25 BST

### 25.2 Binary Search Trees Basics

#### Binary Tree

- length of a path
- depth of a node
- level of the tree
- siblings
- left(right) child of the node
- leaf
- height of a nonempty tree
- height of a empty tree

#### BST

- no duplicate elements
- for every node in the tree , the value of its left child is less than the value of the node, and the value of its right is greater than the value of the node.

### 25.3 Representing Binary Search Tree

can be implemented using a linked structure

- each node contains a value and two links named left and right that reference the left and right child.

  ```java
  class TreeNode<E> {
      protected E element;
      protected TreeNode<E> left;
      protected TreeNode<E> right;

      public TreeNode(E e) {
      element = e;
      }
  }
  ```

- use `root` to refer to the root node of the tree.
- if tree is empty, root is `null`

  ```java
  TreeNode<Integer> root = new TreeNode<>(60);
  root.left = new TreeNode<>(55);
  root.right = new TreeNode<>(100);

  ```

### 25.4 Searching for an Element

- to search, START FROM THE `ROOT` ,and scan down from it until a match is found or arrive at an empty subtree
- repeat compare left and right with you target

  ```java

  public boolean search(E e){

  TreeNode<E> current = root;
  while (current !=null){
      if (e < current.left) {
      current = current.left;
      }
      else if (e > current.element){
      current = current.right;
      }
      else
          reture = ture;
  }
  }

  ```

### 25.5 Inserting an Element into a BST

- CREATE A NODE AS ROOT ,and scan down which node can be this new node's parent

```java

boolean insert(E e){
if (tree is empty)

}else {
    parent = current = root ;
    while (current != null){
     if(e <the value in current.element){
     parent = current;
     current = current.left;
     }else if (e > the value in current.element){

    parent = current;
    curretn = current.right;
    }
    else
      return false
    }
    return ture
}
```

### 25.6 Tree Traversal

- inorder traversal
- postorder traversal
- preorder traversal
